                    Shipping software that works is hard as is. Much worse if
                    you need to connect devices directly. You’ll have to hire at
                    least one distributed systems engineer, they’ll pull &
                    configure a library for you, throw a dart at a pile of
                    whitepapers, and hope they’ve chosen the right techniques.
                    If you’re lucky the first version will land after 6 months
                    of work. When it finally <i class="italic">does</i> ship,
                    the bug reports start.
