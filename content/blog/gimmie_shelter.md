Before we can lean into Iroh as a sync tool, we need to explore answers to Asmir’s very cogent concerns raised in @n0 strategy in a post-FTX world, part II:

> I do have a major concern on the business side in terms of revenue potential (really hard to size the market on this kind of stuff) but also how hard it is to get any revenue to start floating. Ie acquiring first 1, 5, 10 customers. I guess some research has happened on this front, but I don’t have a top of the head buyer for this. This seems like something we sell to solution architects/tech leads/PO/PM and not really neither to devs nor CxOs. Which is a pretty hard sell from my experience. 

The consequence of collapsing on two lines of business: we need a revenue story much sooner, so we can decide if it’s worth betting the project on. The plan will be wrong, but it needs to be a plan everyone can agree to if we were able to pull it off.

We know what we’re leaving behind: a whole community who was excited to see kubo interop in rust. We need to understand where we intend to go. This document explores our potential future from a business perspective.

# Success Criteria

We can’t answer “is this going to work?”, but we can define what we need from the business side:

1. **We need dollar 1 of revenue to flow in Q1 2024.** <br/>
At our current burn rate (and assuming we don’t make any more money), that would give us roughly 6 months to either raise a round or go hard at leveling the plane. In either case the first dollars of revenue are a data point we need to inform that decision.
2. **We need something like ~1.3M in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) to be [default-alive](http://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html)**<br/>
Our burn-rate calculations need work, but it’s somewhere in that ballpark. If we are making one million a year, there’s a good 
3. **We need a lot more than that if we want to build crazy shit**<br/>
We should be looking for a breakout blue ocean strategy that creates meaningful revenue we can use to reinvest to take on harder problems. The goal is to blow through survive & land on thrive.
4. **We can’t lose our commitment to open source**<br/>
Our business model must be compatible with giving away all code for free
5. **It needs to be an incremental improvement on status quo technology**<br/>
None of us are here to grind on a rails app. We want to invent new things that improve quality of life for a lot of people
