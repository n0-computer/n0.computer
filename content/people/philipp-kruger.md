Philipp took a long walk through many programming-related interests from game development to frontend to functional programming to cryptography, but nowadays writes networking software. When he joined, he helped make iroh run in browsers and now is the person everyone else trusts too much to touch the cryptographic bits. Occasionally he might disappear into the nearest forest for a trail run.
