Our content licensing policies are based on those of the [Google Developer](https://developers.google.com/terms/site-policies) website.

We are pleased to license much of the documentation on n0.computer under terms that explicitly encourage people to take, modify, reuse, re-purpose, and remix our work as they see fit.

You will find the following notice at the bottom of many pages on the n0.computer website:

> Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For details, see our [Site Policies](/legal).

When you see a page with this notice you are free to use nearly everything on the page in your own creations. For example, you could quote the text in a book, cut-and-paste sections to your blog, record it as an audiobook for the visually impaired, or even translate it into Swahili. Really. That's what open content licenses are all about. We just ask that you give us attribution when you reuse our work.

You may also find the following notice on the bottom of some pages:

   Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License, and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License. For details, see our Site Policies.

When you see this notice, you are free to use the content, and in addition you are free to use the computer source code that appears in the content (such as in examples) in the code of your own projects.


## What is not licensed?

We say "nearly everything" as there are a few simple conditions that apply.

number 0's trademarks and other brand features are not included in this license. For example, the number 0 logo is not covered, and neither are our trade dress, our other trademarks, or our brand features. You are not allowed to use these without our permission.

In some cases, a page may include content consisting of images, audio or video material, or a link to content on a different webpage (such as videos or slide decks). This content is not covered by the license, unless specifically noted.

## Attribution

Proper attribution is required when you reuse or create modified versions of content that appears on a page made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution license. The complete requirements for attribution can be found in section 3 of the Creative Commons legal code.

In practice we ask that you provide attribution to number 0 to the best of the ability of the medium in which you are producing the work.

There are several typical ways in which this might apply:

### Exact Reproductions

If your online work exactly reproduces text or images from this site, in whole or in part, please include a paragraph at the bottom of your page that reads:

Also, please link back to the original source page so that readers can refer to it for more information.

> Portions of this page are modifications based on work created and shared by number 0 and used according to terms described in the Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution License.

Again, please link back to the original source page so that readers can refer to it for more information. This is even more important when the content has been modified.

### Other Media
If you produce non-hypertext works, such as books, audio, or video, we ask that you make a best effort to include a spoken or written attribution in the spirit of the messages above.
